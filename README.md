# Project Euler

https://projecteuler.net/

For the most part, I'm going to attempt a naive solution (not looking for a mathematical theorem to short-cut) and then move on to googling for shortcuts when I'm not happy with the timing. I want to showcase my thought process as well as my googling skills ;p

I will be attempting to modularize functions and add testing where possible, and I will most likely eventually introduce some kind of caching for certain problems (redis or memcached)

Python 3.12
